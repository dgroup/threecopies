## What does it do?

[ThreeCopies.com](http://www.threecopies.com) is a hosted service that
regularly archives your server-side resources. We create three
copies: hourly, daily and weekly.

What's interesting is that the entire product is written in [EO](http://www.eolang.org),
a truly object-orented programming language.
